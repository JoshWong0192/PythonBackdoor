Developed a Python-based backdoor that simulates a Command and Control (C2) attack in a real-world environment, with the goal of mimicking the tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs) of a real-world attacker. 
The backdoor is designed to establish a reverse connection with a C2 server, allowing for remote access and control of the compromised system.
